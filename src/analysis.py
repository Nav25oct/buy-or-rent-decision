    Given the following financial and market data, analyze whether buying or renting is a better financial decision.

    **Key Considerations:**
    1Ô∏è‚É£ **Monthly mortgage costs** (loan payment, interest, property taxes, insurance, maintenance)
    2Ô∏è‚É£ **Monthly rent vs. affordability** (compare with user's maximum affordable rent)
    3Ô∏è‚É£ **Down payment impact** (how much capital is tied up in a home purchase)
    4Ô∏è‚É£ **Long-term financial implications**:
       - Home equity growth and appreciation potential üìà
       - Opportunity cost: If the down payment were invested in the S&P 500 (historical avg ~7-10% annual return), what could be the projected value? üìä
       - Flexibility: Buying ties capital to real estate; renting provides liquidity.

    **Market Data:**
    ```json
    {json.dumps(market_data, indent=2)}
    ```

    **Final Output Required:**
    - Provide a structured, detailed financial breakdown.
    - Compare renting vs. buying using real-world financial projections.
    - Structure your recommendation into three parts:
      ‚úÖ **Short-term (1-3 years)**: Immediate cash flow, liquidity, flexibility.
      ‚úÖ **Medium-term (4-10 years)**: Equity growth, rent increases, mortgage impact.
      ‚úÖ **Long-term (10+ years)**: Wealth accumulation, property appreciation, opportunity cost vs. market investments.
    - Present the comparison in a structured **tabular format** as follows:

    | Factor                  | Buying Scenario üè† | Renting Scenario üè¢ |
    |-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
    | Property Price          | ${market_data['property_price']:,} | N/A |
    | Monthly Cost (Mortgage) | Based on loan term | ${market_data['monthly_rent']:,} |
    | Down Payment Required   | ${market_data['down_payment']:,} | None |
    | Home Equity Potential   | ‚úÖ Builds Over Time | ‚ùå No Equity Growth |
    | Investment Opportunity  | Down Payment Locked | Can Invest Savings |
    | Maintenance Costs       | ‚úÖ Homeowner Pays | ‚ùå Covered by Landlord |
    | Flexibility             | ‚ùå Limited Mobility | ‚úÖ Can Relocate Easily |
    | Tax Benefits            | ‚úÖ Mortgage Deductions | ‚ùå No Tax Benefits |

    - End with a clear **final recommendation** ("Buy" or "Rent") and explain why.
